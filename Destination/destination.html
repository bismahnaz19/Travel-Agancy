    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why Visit Paris?</h2>
    The capital of France seems to have been designed specifically for the enjoyment of its visitors. Its
    streets, squares, buildings, gardens, and monuments beckon tourists to return, and indeed, many do.
    <br>
    Some of the most memorable things to do in Paris include visiting the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, and
    Notre Dame Cathedral. During the evening, experiencing one of the legendary Moulin Rouge cabaret shows,
    strolling through some of the most picturesque neighborhoods, like Montmartre, or climbing the Montparnasse
    Tower is a must.
    <br>
    It's always a good time to visit Paris. Depending on where you fly from, you can either make the most of the
    low-cost airlines flying into the city from other European cities or take one of its direct flights from
    further away destinations. If you have children, why not surprise them with a trip to Disneyland?
